# Online Grocery Store

### About

* This is my personal project where I try to realise a Single-Page Application for online grocery store. I build the website and API server from ground up, with self-sufficient log in/out, search, filter, comment, history and cart functions. Authorization code flow implemented using Auth0 with PKCE.
* The project is developed in Node.js environment. API is facilitated using Express framework and MongoDB database with data models and interactions. The frontend is polished with Next.js and React.

### Access

This project has been deployed and you can check it out online:
