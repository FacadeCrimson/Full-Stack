# Dashboard for Basil Labs

### About

* This is a geospatial info and data visualisation dashboard that I build for Basil Labs.

* The dashboard's main purpose is to visualize geospatial data related to Long Beach businesses.

* The data includes business score percentile we derive which measures the business vulnerability.

* The Long Beach tab in the sidebar is most important with all relevant data painted.

* The Density Chart is also worth checking as it pictures the distribution of filtered data.

* Long Beach Areas, Kepler Map and Capital One are some explorations on other data.

* D3, leaflet and kepler.gl are utilized for dynamic selection filters, polygon filters and aggregated statistics display.
